# Lolita
a webapp for managing my Lolita dress business.

I only wrote a few webapps. most of which is for internal usage.
first I use plain html + css + js. Though I was new to web development, things were going smoothly.
anything I want to do that I didn't know how, I google it, and within 10s I could get the info I need, easy.

Then I realise that I could make some marks on html and fill in data according to those marks, like loop, filter, sort.
And so I found out that want I wanted to do is basically what Angular does. So, I use Angular instead. 
And I was hit by a enormous mount of obstacles, Bang, hello world didn't work. Bang, tried to use the method showed in examples, it just didn't work.
it took my days after days to fiddle through those silly mistakes I made as a Angular newbee. The reason I think is that there are a lot of implicit info that the docs either didn't mention or are in other chapters. But that's the process of learning new stuff, I got it through, no big deal.

Then after sometime, the app grows. some libs included, which don't necessary cope with the Angular style(which is most of them.). and code would become ugly.
Another problem it comes to me is that Angular is slow. notebaly slow. the only joy it brought to me is when I finally figure out how to make it works and code fit nicely within it's schema. 

So I think maybe it's because Angular isn't good enough. I decided to use another framework, after some search and reading all those sermon about web frameworks. I found that react is quite popular and I was keen on those fancy words and slogans react stated and people said about it, `Declarative` `Component-Based` `Learn Once, Write Anywhere` `Fast` etc.
But soon I found react has an increadbly complex schema. introduced a whole new language. After angular I became cautious. I don't want to use serveral month just to write a simple webapp. Then I found Vue.js . which is quite like react, but simpler.

Then I basically repeated what I did with Angular. And another thing stroke me is that although it's just been serveral month. the tool chain changed dramatically. It took my some more time fiddling through eslint, npm weird bug(searched for hours and finally found solution in a issue page), webpack configuration, etc. what made me angery is those trouble which are completely unnecessary totaly avoidable and has been there for years still didn't get fixed. and of cource, the updates which doesn't care how much conflict it makes.looks like each new version of npm or whatever popular lib get me some more trouble or bugs.

And finally I realise I was wasting month for a simple webapp that could be done in a week or two. And learned some shit that would be changed a few months later. I was so keen on using "popular" "modern" way of doing things. In fear of been regareded as uncool, unpopular, old school. I had enough.

FUCK IT. I'm gonna do it the most old school way. no fucking libs or tools or frameworks. I'm gonna stick with webbrowser standard. I'm gonna stick with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) who documented everything clearly and don't change it like shit.

You can use this project as a template if you like the old school way of web coding. everything is straight forward. everything can be changed for your own situation. no schema forced on you. if you need some code fragments, just take it. no stupid wrapping it into a package.
